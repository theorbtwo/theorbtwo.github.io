So the other day, after attending the AGM of Westmill Solar and seeing
the http://oxfordgreenhouse.co.uk guy talk about, er, his green house
in Oxford, Jess and I got talking about what we wanted to do with the
floor of the basement.  In paticular, the basement isn't damp-proofed
at all, and we want to both do that and put in underfloor heating in
the basement.  Now, putting in a new floor is usually a hard
break-point, by which I mean that once the floor is laid down, you
don't want to pull it back up because you forgot something.  That got
me thinking, what if it wasn't?  Office floors, and especially
server-room floors, tend to be made out of replaceable modules.  When
you want to put in new cable, or, for that matter, just plug something
new in sometimes, you pick up a piece of the carpet (and it's usually
carpet), do what you need to do underneath the floor, and then put it
back.  Easy-peasy, no-fuss, no-muss.  I've never seen such a thing in
an ordinary house, and I think it'd be nice for us... and I think I
see a good way to do it.

I may need to put in a visual aid here soon, but let's just go with
text for the moment.  I spent a while trying to figure out reasonable
example bits and bobs (well, wood flooring plus underlay), but am
getting into poor descriptions on web sites and too-many-decisions, so
I shall stick with hypothetical products for the time being.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor helpfully gives some common
dimensions and suchlike.

Let's say our subfloor consists of plywood panels.  Well, let's say it
consists of [oriented strand board]
(http://www.diy.com/nav/build/timber/sheet-materials/osb/Oriented-Strand-Board-3-L-2400-x-W-1200-x-T-9mm-9276292).
(Did I say I was using hypothetical products?  I lied.)  That's 2400mm
x 1200mm x 9mm.  (7ft 10in x 4ft 1in, to the nearest inch.)  Assume
that the joist spacing is 16 inches.  (Because, obviously, if
everything was nice multiples of the same unit, everything would be
far too easy and not at all fitting Victorian construction.)  Cut the
OSB panels to size, where "to size" is defined as being an integer
multiple of the joist spacing by an integer multiple of the plank
width of our flooring wood.  Get two steel strips, and some
countersunk bolts, appropriate nuts, etc.  Now bolt down the strips to
the bottom of the OSB, along two sides, such that you have a gap of
osb with no steel under it precisely half the width of your joists
between the edge of the osb and the edge of steel.  (You need
countersunk bolts because the top of your underfloor should be nice
and flat.)  On top of that, you glue or nail down your flooring proper
(that is, the bit that shows) to the osb underlay, making sure you
don't try to nail into the steel.

Why the steel?  So that we can pick up the floor with some handles
with bigass magnets on them.  Why the precise spacing?  The edge of
the steel will keep the modules of floor from sliding in the direction
normal to your joists, and we have to make sure that there's no
fulcrum on which a foot in the wrong position could cause a section of
floor to lever up and hit somebody in the face, or suchlike.

Now, anybody have some experience to tell me why this is a silly idea,
or to give me some idea of how much it'll cost, compared to doing
something more traditional?
